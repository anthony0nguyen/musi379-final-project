# MUSI 379 Final Project
> [*and yet a trace of the true self exists in the false self...*](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/and-yet-a-trace-of-the-true-self-exists-in-the-false-self-circle-of-life)

The overall concept for my final project revolves around perception and experiences; more specifically, how I’ve perceived my time at Rice and how I chose to document my experiences. For so long, people have used different methods to preserve their history, and as our own memory slips away, these different methods—photos, diary entries, newspaper clippings—then serve to represent this history. What we choose to document in our lives eventually skews this history, giving us a compressed, often idealized version. I wanted to examine how I have participated in this process, and how my own recorded history might ignore the more difficult and painful things that I’ve been through here at Rice.

A few questions for consideration:
- How do I view myself?
- How have others viewed me?
- How are these perceptions of myself (either by myself or by others) documented?
- How does this differ from my 'true' self-identity?
- *To what extent do the processes of perception and documentation affect my identity?*

The resulting product is a website that takes in webcam video as input, and a composite image made up of photos of myself; a portrait of the user, composed by my portraits. Take a look [here](http://anthony0nguyen.github.io/musi379-final-project/).
